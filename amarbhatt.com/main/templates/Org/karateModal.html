                <div class="content">Through my 11 years of martial arts training I learned that discipline, hardwork, and a drive to succeed are the keys to a life of enlightenment.  I use my training in my every day life, and it helps me to stay focused on my goals. I also learned patience and understanding through teaching Goju Ryu martial arts to students of all levels.
