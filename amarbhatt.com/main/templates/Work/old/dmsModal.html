                <div class="content">My responsibilities include reviewing a customer's requirements and creating an application for their business. Due to software distributed by Database Management Systems and environment constraints I do most of my development on Windows using VBScript or C. I often connect these clients to real world services through my applications using known REST APIs to help them manage their business.
