                    <p>This is a small business run out of Syracuse, NY by one man.  His cliental range from small businesses to medium sized distribution centers both nationally and internationally. He creates a vast array of software services to make the daily tasks of these businesses easier, and eliminate manual data entry. My responsibilities include reviewing his requirements and creating an application for the client. Due to software distributed by Database Management Systems and environment constraints I do most of my development on Windows using VBScript or C. I often connect these clients to real world services through my applications using known REST APIs to help them manage their business. Some of the applications I have worked on that are being used by these clients include Delivery Distance and Time Estimator (used to appropriately and accurately charge for deliveries), Credit Card Transaction System (used to make customer credit card transactions), Local Weather Forecast Data Service (used to determine the effects of weather on business), and Update System Time Service (used to ensure system time is always accurate).</p>
