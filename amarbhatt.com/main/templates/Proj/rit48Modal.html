                <div class="content">Our team designed an Android fashion app with a business plan in 48 hours, that would give instant feedback to a user on their outfits and purchases. A user is able to rate other outfits and get professional advice from a fashion expert. After conducting several surveys and doing extensive market research, the team decided on the topic and presented a working prototype, website and business plan. The team earned 1st place with a $1,500 grand prize, and the opportunity to further develop the idea.
